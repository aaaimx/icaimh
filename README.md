# ICAIMH
Website of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ICAIMH) 2023

This site is modularized through the `fetch(filePath)` function, which has the function of loading each module
created within an **index.html** page. This was done for the frameworkless modularized site.

Because of this, it is necessary for the project to be executed on a web server for its correct visualization.

To solve the path problem, you need to use absolute paths.

## Local site deployment
For this, it is strongly recommended to use the IDE **WebStorm** from JetBrains or, failing that, VS Code but with a separate web server such as XAMP
or some extension for the same purpose. This with the intention of being able to visualize each component correctly and not have problems with absolute paths.

## Deployment of the site on the server
For this, you just need to copy/deploy the project to the root folder of the server.
